                <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Lookup Between Places:</strong> Users can search for the time required to travel between two locations using a lookup table. This feature is likely implemented with pre-calculated or real-time data, allowing quick access to travel times.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploring Nearby Locations (DFS):</strong> For users who want to wander without a specific destination, the system uses Depth First Search (DFS) to suggest nearby locations. This feature helps in casual exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Shortest Path Finder (Dijkstra’s Algorithm):</strong> For users needing the shortest path between two specific locations, this feature employs Dijkstra’s algorithm, ensuring that the travel path avoids disconnections and is optimal.</li>
                <li><strong>Level-by-Level Travel (BFS):</strong> Users can explore locations in a level-wise manner, possibly implemented using Breadth First Search (BFS). This could be useful for hierarchical travel exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Connected Shortest Path Tour (Prim’s Algorithm):</strong> Users looking for a fully connected tour with all places visited can rely on this feature, implemented using Prim’s algorithm. This ensures the shortest connected paths are prioritized.</li>
                <li><strong>Disconnected Shortest Path Tour (Kruskal’s Algorithm):</strong> If a connected tour isn’t necessary, but all locations must be visited via the shortest paths, this feature employs Kruskal’s algorithm to design an efficient route.</li>

        <h1>Reflection on Designing and Implementing the Transport Management System</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Organizing User Tasks</h2>
        <p>
            I had to break down the different things a user might want to do into clear, distinct options. This makes the system easy to navigate. For example, you can either search for the shortest path between two places, explore nearby locations without worrying about the shortest route, or even visit places like hospitals or police stations. By giving users clear choices, they can quickly find what they're looking for.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Choosing the Right Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
            I had to pick algorithms that suit the task at hand:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</strong> is great for finding the shortest route between two points, which is perfect for the travel scenarios where time matters.</li>
            <li><strong>DFS (Depth First Search)</strong> is useful when the goal is to explore locations without worrying about the most efficient path. It’s like wandering through a city, taking different paths just to see what’s there.</li>
            <li><strong>BFS (Breadth First Search)</strong> is helpful for when we want to visit places level by level, starting from a point and gradually expanding outward.</li>
            <li><strong>Prim's and Kruskal’s Algorithms</strong> are used for connected, efficient routes. Prim's ensures all places are visited in the shortest connected path, while Kruskal’s focuses on covering all places without needing a connected path, but still in the shortest way possible.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>User Experience and Simplicity</h2>
        <p>
            Overall, I aimed for simplicity in how users interact with the system. Whether they're looking for a specific place, making a payment, or giving a rating, everything is broken down into manageable steps. The system’s layout is designed to let users focus on what they need without feeling overwhelmed by too many options at once.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Handling Location-Specific Needs</h2>
        <p>
            Including options for emergency services (like hospitals, police stations, and fire departments) makes the system more practical and adds a layer of real-world usefulness. It feels more connected to everyday needs.
