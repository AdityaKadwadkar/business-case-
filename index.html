            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Lookup Between Places:</strong> Users can search for the time required to travel between two locations using a lookup table. This feature is likely implemented with pre-calculated or real-time data, allowing quick access to travel times.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploring Nearby Locations (DFS):</strong> For users who want to wander without a specific destination, the system uses Depth First Search (DFS) to suggest nearby locations. This feature helps in casual exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Shortest Path Finder (Dijkstra’s Algorithm):</strong> For users needing the shortest path between two specific locations, this feature employs Dijkstra’s algorithm, ensuring that the travel path avoids disconnections and is optimal.</li>
                <li><strong>Level-by-Level Travel (BFS):</strong> Users can explore locations in a level-wise manner, possibly implemented using Breadth First Search (BFS). This could be useful for hierarchical travel exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Connected Shortest Path Tour (Prim’s Algorithm):</strong> Users looking for a fully connected tour with all places visited can rely on this feature, implemented using Prim’s algorithm. This ensures the shortest connected paths are prioritized.</li>
                <li><strong>Disconnected Shortest Path Tour (Kruskal’s Algorithm):</strong> If a connected tour isn’t necessary, but all locations must be visited via the shortest paths, this feature employs Kruskal’s algorithm to design an efficient route.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Highlights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Navigation Input:</strong> Users can manually input their desired location and receive guidance or travel details to reach it.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment System:</strong> A feature for users to make travel-related payments, which might integrate with various payment gateways.</li>
                <li><strong>User Ratings:</strong> Users can provide feedback or rate the service or application based on their experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency Services:</strong>
                    <ul>
